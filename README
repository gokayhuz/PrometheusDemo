Sample JAVA app that exports basic and custom metrics for Prometheus to
collect. The metrics are exported at http://localhost:8081/prometheus-metrics

There is also a Grafana dashboard that can be used to monitor the exported
metrics. 

The dashboard requires a running instance of Prometheus on the local host
and the datasource to be available at http://localhost:9090 (which is the
system default for Prometheus) and named "test_data_source"

The Prometheus server should be started at the project's root folder (or the
included config file specified with the --config.file parameter at startup)
